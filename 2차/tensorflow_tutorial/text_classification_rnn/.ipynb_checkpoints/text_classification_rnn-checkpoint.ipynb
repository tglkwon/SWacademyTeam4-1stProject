The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning.

Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release. Judging from the results, that is a completely believable (and baffling) scenario.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "3. After the encoder is an embedding layer. An embedding layer stores one vector per word. When called, it converts the sequences of word indices to sequences of vectors. These vectors are trainable. After training (on enough data), words with similar meanings often have similar vectors.\n",

    "5. After the RNN has converted the sequence to a single vector the two `layers.Dense` do some final processing, and convert from this vector representation to a single logit as the classification output. \n"
